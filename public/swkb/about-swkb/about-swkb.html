    <h1>about swkb&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowledge Base of Software</h1>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {swkb/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
      href="./">about-swkb/*</a># &nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The SoftWare Knowledge base is a collection of chunks of information
    created and maintained in association with the x-square project of
    NodeJS-Houston.<br>
    <br>
    The main goal of the project is to learn the tools and processes of
    developing a modern data-driven web site.<br>
    <br>
    Secondarily, we may create some useful components and/or a working
    web site.<br>
    <br>
    In order to capture a concise abstract&nbsp; of the information
    learned in order to recall it later and to be useful to others, this
    is a condensed form of the uncontrolled and minimally organized
    information available on the web.<br>
    <br>
    This will work in conjunction with project-specific information
    managed in parallel, and linked, but separate.<br>
    <br>
    swkb will be organized by generally well identified tools,
    components that become a part of x-square or any similar
    project.&nbsp; Each wil get it's own subfolder. This will maintain
    modular, organized information.<br>
    <br>
    A second type of tool I call collaboration tools, such as slack and
    trello.&nbsp; They are used in the process of the team
    collaborating, but not necessarily as final components.&nbsp; They
    will also have a similar separate subfolder under swkb/<br>
    <br>
    Certain types of pages may be indicated by keywords in their
    pagenames. For example a page with summaries and links to tutorials
    may include tut- in the page name.&nbsp; Usually a tool involves ten
    or twenty key concepts. These may get pages each, with prefix
    hbt-&nbsp; for HandleBarsTerms eg templates, precompile, expression,
    route,...)<br>
    <br>
    The objective in folder structure and page-naming is to make it
    humanly easy to<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) add new information so it will be accessible
    and not duplicated - you can see what is there.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; similarly know
    which folder a given chunk should be placed in.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) keep the number of files in a folder to about
    20 or max 50.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This makes
    scanning the filenames to create links or to find info manageable<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) to identify holes of potentially useful
    chunks missing to add them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Keeping chunks to be visible in one
    screen without scrolling, unless good reason.<br>
